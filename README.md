# Waterworld Datapack

This is a WIP data pack for Minecraft versions 1.21 or 1.21.1 (as of 19.09.24). Just download the pack once and apply it as a ressource pack and in the world selection screen as a data pack. You can just drag the file into the selection view. The game will inform you if you use the wrong game version.

More information will follow soonâ„¢.

## Current Status of the Project

Although progress may be slow (because I do this in my free time, which I unfortunatly don't have a lot of), but progress is being done. Here is a short (incomplete) list of things that I have on my to-do list:
- [x] Add new dimension "Waterworld"
- [x] Spawn in the dimension "Waterworld" in a safe structure with a tree
- [x] Make impure ores that must be refined in the stonecutter for more ressources
    - [ ] Add shaped crafting recipes for this to enable automation using the crafter.
- [x] Add a fallback data- and ressource pack to make the combination of data- and ressource pack into one .zip file (I call this a feature pack) possible.
- [x] Add a base building system with premade modules
- [x] Add tags for every custom item
- [ ] Finish story advancements
- [x] Generate custom structures on the sea floor with custom loot tables
    - [ ] Improve the underwater lab with interior, mob spawners, etc.
- [ ] Complete this list
